Sorry about that I was actually on the phone with somebody from your office and question a billing but they helped me and I took care of that . \n\nI was just in question of your text message from Jacob he's obviously currently looking for a new vehicle we added him to my policy with the SR-22 . Just wanted to confirm your message as far as when he gets his permit which will be here in the next week or so to show proof of that and hopefully by then we can have a car in place and then hopefully he can take over his own insurance policy at that time as well .",
